# **Ad-Behavior-Analysis-Logistic-Regression**  
### Predicting Ad Click Behavior Using Logistic Regression  

---

## 📋 Overview  
This repository demonstrates a project that predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement using a **logistic regression model**. The analysis is conducted on a dataset containing user demographics, online behavior, and advertisement interaction details. This project illustrates the complete process of building a classification model, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.  

---

## 📊 Dataset Features  
The dataset comprises the following user attributes, providing valuable insights into online behaviors:  
- **Daily Time Spent on Site**: Average time (in minutes) spent on the website by the user.  
- **Age**: Age of the user in years.  
- **Area Income**: Average income of users in their geographical region.  
- **Daily Internet Usage**: Daily internet usage in minutes.  
- **Ad Topic Line**: The headline of the advertisement.  
- **City**: User’s city of residence.  
- **Gender**: Binary indicator (1 for male, 0 for female).  
- **Country**: User’s country of residence.  
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the interaction.  
- **Clicked on Ad**: Target label indicating whether the user clicked the ad (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Build a predictive model to classify whether a user is likely to click on an advertisement.  
- Analyze the relationship between user attributes and their likelihood to interact with ads.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed missing values and standardized the dataset for modeling.  
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Implemented a classification model using Python’s scikit-learn library.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and visualized the confusion matrix.  
- **Data Visualization**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations for better insights.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.  
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing logistic regression and evaluation metrics.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries to interpret data trends and results.
